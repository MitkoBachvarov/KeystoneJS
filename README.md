# KeystoneJS
This is a simple project, which shows how to use KeystoneJS <br/>

## What it does
Basically what this code does is apply the Admin panel from Keystone, which can be accessed by typing "http://localhost:3000/keystone". 
The code demonstrates how to create a section in the admin panel.

## How to run
First you need to do a npm install <br/>
Then you need to connect to a MongoDB. For further information on how to connect check below.<br/>
Then all you need to do is run "node keystone.js" and that's it. <br/>
Pages you can open:<br/>
http://localhost:3000/keystone   - admin page. Login data is in 'updates/0.0.1-first-user.js' <br/>
http://localhost:3000/           - Index page, nothing specific there <br/>
http://localhost:3000/add-event  - add Event form where you are able to add an event to the Admin panel. (This part of the code is still a work in progress.) <br/>
